                  I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a
                  case of an error in the app I collect data and information
                  (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data.
                  This Log Data may include information such as your device
                  Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating
                  system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my

                <h2 class="title is-3">Cookies</h2>
                <p class="is-size-6">
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory. <br /><br />
                  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                  the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                  You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
                  and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                  choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some

                <p class="is-size-6">
                  I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the

                <ul class="is-size-6">
                  <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>

                  I want to inform users of this Service that these third
                  parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason
                  is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf.
                  However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the
                  information for any other purpose.

                  I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information,
                  thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of
                  protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission
                  over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100%
                  secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute
                  security.

                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I
                  strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these

                <p class="is-size-6">
                  These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do
                  not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
                  children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under
                  13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately
                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                  personal information, please contact me so that I will be able
                  to do necessary actions.
