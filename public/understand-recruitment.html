                <h2>The employer’s perspective</h2>
                <h3>They have a need</h3>
                <p>
                  Hiring staff is always about a particular need which serves
                  the goals of the organisation, e.g. replacing someone who has
                  left, growing the team, diversifying their skills, acquiring
                  specific expertise. Even those organisations which have large
                  annual graduate schemes keep them because they meet their
                  business needs, but you shouldn’t assume that any two
                  employers’ needs will be the same.
                </p>
                <h3>They are taking a risk</h3>
                <p>
                  It follows that recruitment always entails risk: if you need
                  something to be done, hiring the wrong person could do damage
                  to you, your team, or your organisation. At best, you will
                  have to let the person go and re-appoint, but recruitment is
                  costly and time-consuming. At worst, you will be stuck with an
                  employee who hampers your work on an ongoing basis. Graduate
                  recruiters may also worry about whether you might turn them
                  down or leave if you get a better offer.
                </p>
                <h2>You have a task</h2>
                <h3>Inspire trust</h3>
                <p>
                  This inherent risk is why employers have to trust you. Your
                  application (and the selection process which follows) must
                  convince the employer that you can do the job, you will do the
                  job, and that you will be a good ‘fit’ with the rest of the
                  team. That’s why you can’t send identical applications to
                  multiple employers: they can’t put their trust in something
                  which is generic and not tailored to their needs. Why should
                  they?
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h2>How employers will look at you</h2>
                <p>
                  How employers select candidates to call to interview can be
                  hugely varied, and selection often involves multiple
                  processes. The factors they are assessing when looking at your
                  application can be organised under the following three
                  headings:
                </p>
                <h3>1. Eligibility</h3>
                <p>
                  Do you meet the requirements to do this job? Do you have the
                  necessary qualifications, experience, and skills? In many job
                  descriptions, these will be listed as ‘essential’. If you
                  don’t meet these criteria, you are simply ineligible and won’t
                  be shortlisted.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Suitability</h3>
                <p>
                  What kind of person are you? Will you fit well with the rest
                  of the team? Do you share the organisation’s values and ethos?
                  The language you use, the experiences you prioritise, what you
                  say about your motivations – these all help give an impression
                  of how suitable you are.
                </p>
                <h3>3. Potential</h3>
                <p>
                  Employers will always be interested in what you might achieve
                  in years to come, and past achievement is regarded as the best
                  predictor of future performance. But do you also have ideas
                  about the role and how it might develop? What’s your plan for
                  ensuring success?
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h2>Remember</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Employers are taking a risk when they hire new staff</li>
                  <li>
                    A good application starts with thinking about the employer,
                    not about yourself
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Generic applications, sent off to lots of prospective
                    employers without being adapted, don’t work because they
                    don’t address the individual employers’ particular needs
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Make yourself appear less of a risk by targeting your
                    application carefully – show that you are capable of doing
                    the job, you are motivated to do it, and you will fit in
                    well
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Don’t assume employers will automatically see your
                    potential. Give them a reason to trust it
                  </li>
                </ul>
