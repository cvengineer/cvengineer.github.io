                <p class="is-size-6">
                  By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                  allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                  our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                  extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                  to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
                  versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                  database rights and other intellectual property rights related
                  to it, still belong to Matthew Callery. <br /><br />
                  Matthew Callery is committed to ensuring that the app is as
                  useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve
                  the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
                  services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge
                  you for the app or its services without making it very clear
                  to you exactly what you’re paying for. <br /><br />
                  The CV Engineer app stores and processes personal data that
                  you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s
                  your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app
                  secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or
                  root your phone, which is the process of removing software
                  restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
                  system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
                  malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                  security features and it could mean that the CV Engineer app
                  won’t work properly or at all. <br /><br />
                  You should be aware that there are certain things that Matthew
                  Callery will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of
                  the app will require the app to have an active internet
                  connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your
                  mobile network provider, but Matthew Callery cannot take
                  responsibility for the app not working at full functionality
                  if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of
                  your data allowance left. <br /><br />
                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                  other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                  <br /><br />
                  Along the same lines, Matthew Callery cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Matthew
                  Callery cannot accept responsibility. <br /><br />
                  With respect to Matthew Callery’s responsibility for your use
                  of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear
                  in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. Matthew Callery accepts no liability for any loss,
                  direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                  wholly on this functionality of the app. <br /><br />
                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                  currently available on Android – the requirements for
                  system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
                  availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
                  download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
                  Matthew Callery does not promise that it will always update
                  the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
                  Android version that you have installed on your device.
                  However, you promise to always accept updates to the
                  application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
                  providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
                  without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell
                  you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
                  licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must
                  stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
                  device.
